I started a little project today, it will be a booking web app. I'm having a hard time starting off , there's still alot to learn about #django.

Day 16.
**Today's progress**: had to restart the project to make Custom User -which I just learn how to configure- and figured out how to work with widgets. I also learned that there are more than one way to work with forms in django. I feel tired now, tomorrow I'll work more on the forms in my project.

Day 17.

Day 28.
**Today's progress**: I modified the sign up info, now a user is asked a email, username and phone number. This was possible because I had set up a custom user before starting the project, so I could Custom my UserForm and alter the database tables.

Day 29.
**Today's progress**: I hadn't done much work today, except for modifying the home page so now it shows details for the booking.

day 30.
**Today's progress**: The more you know the more you realize how much you don't know. It's true for python's Django nd it feels good to learn more.
Today I added a model field to represent the number of hours for a booking, changed the views function and the html templates.

day 31.
**Today's progress**: Today I didn't add anything to the web app, all I did was some clash codes at codingame.com which is really fun, so I decided to do at least three clash codes a day from now on.

Day 32.
**Today's progress**: I learned how to delete data from database, and that #Django don't call a model's proper delete function unless you iterate through the #queryset and run delete on each instance.

Day 33.
The app I'm working on is a booking app for a co-working space, it asks the user to book a number of hours each day. I added a possibility to have a certain max number for each hour, since there could be many users book at the same hour.

Day 34.
Today I Learnt how to display notifications to users, it's not hard having django providing the messages framework. 
And I displayed an alert when a user tries to book in date already booked by the max number.

Day 35.
Haven't done so much work, except for the daily challenges at #codingame and reading through #Django documentation which proved to be helpful every time.

Day 36.
**Today's progress**: I 've been wanting to customize my admin page, django admin site does get alot of work out of the way, but I needed to make my own templates.
I looked up for the best ways to achieve this, I decided to go with django #Django #Adminplus package.
**Link to package**: https://github.com/jsocol/django-adminplus

Day 37.
**Today's progress**: Today was kinda frustrating, as it turned up Adminplus didn't work out for me.
I spent most of the time between stackoverflow and django's documentation trying to find out the best way to customize the #django admin site

Day 38.
I'm still struggling  with developing the admin pages.
I couldn't find out what would work for me, but in the end of the day I come across the book: Django admin cookbook, and I decided to read it in order to have a better idea of how django works.

Day 39.
Today I read through half the book: django admin cookbook (it's a only 50pages) I took my time and did as usual a lot of googling .
